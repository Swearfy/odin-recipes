    <h1>Meatballs</h1>
<img src="./img/Meatballs.png">
<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>A meatball is ground meat rolled into a ball, sometimes along with other ingredients, such as bread crumbs, minced onion, eggs, butter, and seasoning. Meatballs are cooked by frying, baking, steaming, or braising in sauce. There are many types of meatballs using different types of meats and spices</p>

<h3>Restores:</h3>
    <p> Hunger <img src="./img/Hunger_Meter.png"> 62.5, Health <img src="./img/Health_Meter.png"> 3, Sanity <img src="./img/Sanity_Meter.png"> 5</p>
<h3>Pros:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The most flexible food of all. Meatballs can be made from nearly any ingredient combination. Just make sure you have at least one morsel or monster meat, and it will probably work.</li>
        <li>It can also turn trash into treasure. Mushrooms, Monster Meat, rotting food, red mushrooms, or Ice can all become 62.5 points of hunger with no penalties.</li>
        <li>Needs no special structures or tools aside from the crock pot.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Cons:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Only 10 days of spoil time means that you won't get far without having to deal with stale food. You also can't stockpile meatballs to preserve ingredients with much effectiveness.</li>
    <li>Virtually no HP restoration.</li>
</ul>
   <h3>Using it best:</h3>
       <p>Use this recipe when you have a lot of garbage food to get rid of. You can even make meatballs from cooked monster meat if you have a birdcage to convert 3 of them to eggs.</p>
